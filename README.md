## 1. Introduction

**Scrum Agent** is an open-source, AI-powered supervisor designed to enhance agile project management within Discord communities. Acting as a virtual Scrum Master, this agent integrates multiple tools to streamline sprint planning, issue tracking, research, and team collaboration.

By mapping individual Discord channels to corresponding Taiga projects, Scrum Agent facilitates seamless user story management through threaded discussions—ensuring efficient workflow management and improved project oversight.

Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ADV99kyfjg) to test the Scrum Agent and explore its features.

### Project Goals, Audience & Maturity

Scrum Agent is particularly helpful for **small dev teams** without a dedicated Scrum Master, but can also be used by **larger teams** looking to keep their Discord conversations and Taiga board in sync. **Currently**, it’s designed for Discord and Taiga, but we **plan** to extend support to **Slack and Jira** as well.

The project is **still in an early stage** and is under active development—use it at your own risk. That said, we welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help shape its future.

</p>

**Left:** Updating a user story in Discord  
**Right:** The updated user story in Taiga

### Creating or Updating an Issue

</p>

**Left:** Creating or updating an issue in Discord  
**Right:** The newly created or updated issue in Taiga

### Stand‑up Scheduling via Tags

| Tag on the Taiga user story | Bot behaviour | Where to add it                                                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `daily stand‑up`            | Stand‑up **every day** (incl. weekends) | <img src="assets/daily_stand-up.png" alt="Tag field in Taiga" height="30"/>  |
| `weekly stand‑up`           | Stand‑up **Mondays only**              | <img src="assets/weekly_stand-up.png" alt="Tag field in Taiga" height="30"/> |
| _no tag_                    | Stand‑up **Mondays only** (default)   | —                                                                            |

**How to use**

1. Open the user story in **Taiga**.  
2. In the **Tags** field add either `daily stand‑up` or `weekly stand‑up`.  
3. If neither tag is set, the bot automatically posts on weekdays.

_No extra configuration needed – this logic is built into the bot._

## 5. System Architecture

### Overview

Scrum Agent is built on the [Langgraphs Supervisor Agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/agent_supervisor/), which allows for flexible integration of multiple agents and tools. For more technical details, please refer to the Langgraphs documentation.

#### Architecture Diagram

### Adding Agents and Tools

- **Adding Agents:**  
  Insert new agent nodes in `build_agent_graph.py`.

- **Supervisor Configuration:**  
  Update `supervisor_agent.py` with the agent's name and description. Ensure that the names are consistent.

1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=True
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_project_name
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key (refer to `.env.example` for guidance).

2. **Learn More:**
