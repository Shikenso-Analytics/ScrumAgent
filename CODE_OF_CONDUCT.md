# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and harassment-free environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a respectful experience for everyone. This applies to all project spaces (including GitHub, Discord channels, and other online or offline mediums), no matter one’s background, identity, or level of experience.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy towards other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Using sexualized language or imagery, or any form of sexual attention  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ADV99kyfjg). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
